Helloooo....
In this repository, I will be adding projects that I've completed and simulated using the STM32F103C8 microcontroller.
These projects will range from basic GPIO configuration to more advanced ADC configuration.

Project1 -> Simple I/O configuration to blink onBoard LED of the microcontroller without using Timer

Project2 -> Creation of GPIO Library, Using External GPIO Interrupt, Using actual Timer

Project3 -> Using Timer Interrupt

Project4 -> Creation of Systick library and using USART communication, Creation of USART Library

Project5 -> USART Interrupt and its library

Project6 -> USART Advanced Communication Setup
